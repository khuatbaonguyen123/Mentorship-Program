## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª B. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?

**Solution**

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE product_statistics AS
WITH purchase_events AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
    FROM events
    WHERE event_type = 3
)
SELECT 
    ph.product_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS view_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 AND pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 AND pe.visit_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandon_count
FROM events e
JOIN page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
LEFT JOIN purchase_events pe ON e.visit_id = pe.visit_id
WHERE ph.product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ph.product_id;
```

***

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

**Solution**

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE product_category AS
SELECT p.product_category, 
	SUM(ps.view_count) AS view_count,
    SUM(ps.cart_add_count) AS cart_add_count,
    SUM(ps.abandon_count) AS abandon_count,
    SUM(ps.purchase_count) AS purchase_count
FROM 
	product_statistics ps 
JOIN 
	page_hierarchy p on ps.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_category;
```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**

```sql
SELECT product_id,
	   view_count,
       cart_add_count,
       purchase_count
FROM product_statistics
ORDER BY view_count DESC, cart_add_count DESC, purchase_count DESC;
```

**2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**

```sql
SELECT product_id,
	   abandon_count
FROM product_statistics
ORDER BY abandon_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?**

```sql
SELECT product_id,
	   ROUND(purchase_count * 100 / view_count, 2) AS view_to_purchase_perc
FROM product_statistics
ORDER BY view_to_purchase_perc DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cart_add_count / view_count), 2) AS avg_view_to_cart_add_rate
FROM product_statistics;
```

**5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(purchase_count / cart_add_count), 2) AS avg_cart_add_to_purchase_rate
FROM product_statistics;
```

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª C. Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
  
**Solution**

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE unique_visit AS
SELECT u.user_id, e.visit_id, MIN(e.event_time) AS visit_start_time, 
	SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
	SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases,
    c.campaign_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
    GROUP_CONCAT(CASE WHEN p.product_id IS NOT NULL AND ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN p.page_name ELSE NULL END, ', ' ORDER BY e.sequence_number) AS products
FROM users u
JOIN events e ON u.cookie_id = e.cookie_id
LEFT JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier c ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
JOIN event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN page_hierarchy p ON e.page_id = p.page_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, e.visit_id, c.campaign_name;
```
